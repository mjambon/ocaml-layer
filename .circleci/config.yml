#
# Build and push a docker image for each change on the main branch and
# weekly.
#
# This occurs after merging a PR or after pushing directly to the main
# branch. We also build an image every week to keep things fresh since
# it updates the list of available opam packages and installs the
# latest version of unpinned packages.
#
# Images get tagged with a date like '2021-04-08'. If multiple images
# get built on the same day, they will overwrite each other, which is
# fine.
