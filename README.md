# Make and host your own OCaml base image

The goal is to set up a cachable build environment on which one can
build OCaml software. Requirements include:

* Pre-installing all the external dependencies needed by the user's
  projects. A list of opam packages is to be provided
  by the user. By "external dependency", we mean any dependency that
  doesn't change too often. These shouldn't be rebuilt each time the
  user wants to test new code, because it wastes time.
* Composability with other setup scripts. For example, we may want to
  set up a Go development environment as well, so we need to ability
  to use a base Docker image that comes with Go pre-installed.
  The user should be able to specify the base image of their choice as
  long as it falls within a supported family e.g. "Alpine" or
  "Debian-like".
* No need to know OCaml or to have OCaml installed on your machine to
  set this up.
* Easy customization by forking and editing this project.

Usage
--

For evaluation purposes, you can simply run `make` and watch
an image being built with the default settings.

For actual use, follow these steps:

1. Create your own Docker repository on the
   [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry or elsewhere.
2. Fork this git repository or create a branch.
3. Run `make init` to create `config.sh`, then edit it to suit your needs.
4. Run `make` to build a Docker image locally.
5. Run `make push` to upload the image.
6. Use this image as a base image in your CI jobs.

If you want to maintain multiple images, put the config files into
`configs/` and run `make all`. This will use them instead of `config.sh`.

Suggestions
--

* For testing multiple versions of OCaml, you may want to create and
  maintain one git branch per version.
* If you're an individual open-source developer, you may want to
  target two versions of OCaml: the minimum version that you're
  willing to support and the latest version.
* The [ocaml/opam2 images](https://hub.docker.com/r/ocaml/opam2/)
  already support many flavors of operating systems and are
  graciously maintained for you. You probably should use those if the
  speed of routine CI builds isn't a priority for you.

Unknowns
--

Please suggest answers if you know them!

* Docker Hub provides a way to automatically build images when your
  git repository changes. Some code to set this up would be nice. I
  don't know how it works.
* Docker Hub doesn't seem to provide periodic builds. It would be
  handy to upgrade packages on a daily or weekly basis.
  Is there a simple solution for this?
